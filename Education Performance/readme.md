# 🎓 Education Performance & Resource Allocation Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of a Power BI case study where I designed an **interactive dashboard** to evaluate **student academic performance** and analyze **resource allocation** across departments.  
The goal was to provide **actionable insights** for education management and optimize institutional resources.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Student Performance Analysis**
  - KPIs: Total Students, Pass Count, Pass %, Average Score, Avg Attendance
  - Trend of Scores by Semester
  - Pass vs Fail count by Department
  - Performance comparison across Subjects & Departments  

- **Resource Allocation Analysis**
  - Department-wise Funding & Resource Utilization
  - Teachers vs Classrooms Allocation
  - Library Usage by Department
  - Departmental summary table with Scores, Funding, Attendance & Lab Hours
  - KPI Cards: Best Performing Dept, Avg Teachers, Total Funding, Avg Lab Hours

## 📈 Insights
- Around **73% students pass**, with noticeable fail counts in **Arts & Commerce**.  
- **Science Department** achieves the best outcomes despite mid-level funding → high efficiency.  
- **Semesters 7** show a decline in average scores, indicating possible syllabus/teaching gaps.  
- **Accounting & Philosophy** are weak subjects with consistently low scores.  
- **Medicine receives high funding** but struggles with fail counts → scope to optimize resource usage.  
- Library usage is highest in **Commerce** and lowest in **Engineering**, showing different learning patterns.
